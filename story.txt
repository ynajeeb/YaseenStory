There once was a boy named Phil. Phil loved to eat Cheetos and drink Mountain Dew. He decided to visit his friendâ€™s house one day. They were out of Cheetos and Mountain Dew. The boys panicked. It was already 10:30 pm and all of the nearby grocery stores were already closed. They felt uneasy and extremely hungry. Both of them thought about how tonight might as well be the worst night of their entire lives. Hungry for their cheetos they started to walk to the next store nearby. Much to their amazement they witnessed something on the street that shook them to their core.
