There once was a boy named Phil. Phil loved to eat Cheetos and drink Mountain Dew. He decided to visit his friendâ€™s house one day. They were out of Cheetos and Mountain Dew. The boys panicked. It was already 10:30 pm and all of the nearby grocery stores were already closed. They felt uneasy and extremely hungry. Both of them thought about how tonight might as well be the worst night of their entire lives. Hungry for their cheetos they started to walk to the next store nearby. Much to their amazement they witnessed something on the street that shook them to their core. A Cheeto monster 30 feet tall was running at them drinking a giant bottle of Mountain Dew. Phil and his friend had seen scenarios like this in video games, but would have never thought they would ever encounter such a thing in real life. They needed to figure out it's weakness. The Cheeto Monster swung at them, barely scraping them with orange dush flying everywhere. The Cheeto Monster took a break and fueled up on Mountain Dew, and that was when Phil knew that they needed to get rid of it's power source, the Mountain Dew.
